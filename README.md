I'm Tr·∫ßn Duy ƒê·ª©c, a full-stack developer with 1-year experience in AngularJS, or, to be full, the MEAN stack. I had some experience with Google Apps Script to create complex apps in Google Sheets.

In my free time, I work on my personal projects, with the most notable one being [my original music and video game music remixes](https://soundcloud.com/tduyduc), [all composed in a way similar to coding](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHREXHRSxg4Lw8i0p4mKrw), which makes myself a "music developer".
